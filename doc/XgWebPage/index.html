                <p><img class="imageleft" src="images/main.PNG" alt="" width=400/>The Xg Engine Library introduces an object-oriented API used for creating games animation, simulations and data visualization.  The creation of an <b>XgEngine</b> object is the controlling mechanism for creating, managing and executing a Xg Engine Library scene.  A scene defines all assets, asset behaviors, light sources and view positions related to the animation.  It is the scene that the developer must create and pass to the engine.  Without a scene, there is nothing to animate.  The Xg Engine Library provides several defaults and templates that allow for quick development of some scenes and object values.  These objects and defaults will be introduced later in this tutorial.  The execution of a scene requires a three-step approach.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Creation of the <b>XgEngine</b> object, which can be accomplished via a set of constructors.  These constructors allow for the definition of basic overall scene attributes such as frame-per-second, window width and height.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>XgScene</b> object is added to the engine for execution.  The scene object stores all of the assets contained within the animation and the behavior of each object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>XgEngine</b> object executes the scene and renders the actual animation window.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Xg Engine Library presents a object oriented API used for creating games animation, simulations and data visualization.  The creation of an <b>XgEngine</b> object is the controlling mechism for creating, managing and executing a Xg Engine scene.  The execution of a scene requires a three step approach.</p>

                <p><img class="imageleft" src="images/Figure01.PNG" alt="" width=400/>
                A basic example of the Xg Engine Library API is a spinning sphere.  Placing a sphere in the middle of the scene and creating a hovering light is a straightforward task.  The view (or camera) position is located in front of the sphere to view the specular default lighting.
